# Data Mining Project on Glasgow Norms
Data Mining project for the 2021/2022 UniPI course of Data Science and Business Informatics.
By [Agnese Marchionneschi](https://github.com/agneseMarchionneschi) and [Michele Papucci](https://github.com/michelepapucci)

The project was an in-depth analysis of the [Glagow Norms dataset](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6538586/). We did an in-depth exploration of the dataset, followed by experiments using unsupervised (clustering) and supervised (classification) models, and in the end we tried a pattern mining approach by discretizing the data as transactions.
